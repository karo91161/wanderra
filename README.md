# Wanderra 🌍

**Wanderra** is a travel-focused web application and a **learning** project built with React, designed to explore real-world concepts like routing, map integration, and UI state management.  

This is a **frontend-only project** created for educational purposes.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Authentication is simulated with a **fake login** system. No backend is connected.
